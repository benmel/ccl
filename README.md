ccl
===

- Processes a binary (black and white) image to find connected regions
- Compares the color of a pixel to that of its surroundings
- If neighboring pixels are the same color they have the same label
- Uses an equivalence table to reduce number of labels
- In the output image each connected area has a different color
- Usage: `python ccl.py [-sf] â€“i <input_file> [-o <output_file>]`
- `-sf` flag is for a size filter, meaning a filter is applied to remove small pixel regions
- Output is either shown or saved to a file with `-o` flag
